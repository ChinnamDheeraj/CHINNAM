Health Failure Prediction  

Overview
This project aims to predict health failures using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of various health parameters that help in identifying individuals at risk.  

Dataset  
- The dataset contains patient health records with features like blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, etc.  
- The target variable indicates whether a patient is at risk of health failure.  

Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy for data preprocessing  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization  
- Scikit-Learn for machine learning models  
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis
